        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Summer25 is a web application developed in the summer of 2025, born as an experiment and proposed as a recreational or educational tool.

            <h2>Quick Try</h2>
            <p>To get an idea of what Summer25 can do before delving into the manual, you can use one of these
                two options:.
            <ul>
                <li>Load one of the example presets from the <b>Preset</b> box on the left, press <kbd>P</kbd> to play it,
                    then drag the mouse while holding the left button in the central square area.</li>
                <li>Load two random audio files, one for the X-axis and one for the Y-axis by pressing Alt-<kbd>X</kbd> and Alt-<kbd>Y</kbd>, 
                    enter <i>drag</i> mode with <kbd>D</kbd> and start
                    experimenting directly as above (<kbd>P</kbd> and then drag).</li>
                    <i>Note: you can continue to change samples on the fly during the test.</i>
            </ul>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Summer25 was created to experiment with real-time browser audio,
                using the synthesis and resynthesis technique called "Phase Vocoder". 
                The main goal is the interactive spectral combination of two sounds called X and Y. 
                Additional features were integrated during development.
            </p>
            <p>The application is not intended for professional use, although it can produce interesting
                sound combinations. It is conceived instead as a recreational or educational tool to encourage even
                less experienced users to experiment with sound synthesis.</p>
            <p>It uses two sounds that are mapped onto the X and Y axes of the workspace. By moving the mouse, it is
                possible to select a point within the X sound and the Y sound. At that point, the spectrum is
                calculated via phase vocoder analysis, the two spectra are combined in various ways, and the result
                is resynthesized in real time.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>First, load two audio files, one for the X-axis and one for the Y-axis. The
                WAV, MP3, and OGG formats are supported. The application handles both short sounds (samples) and complete musical tracks. Some
                example files are available in the application (use the "load" button in the "X Wave"
                and "Y Wave" sections on the left). It is also possible to load your own files from the disk using the
                "load" buttons or by dragging and dropping them from your file system into the respective sections or into the strips above and to the left of the main
                panel.</p>

            <p>Once the files are loaded, press the Play button at the top left to start the synthesis and move
                within the main panel while holding down the left mouse button.</p>

            <h2>Drag</h2>

            <h2>Motion</h2>
            <p>By varying the <i>x,y</i> coordinates within the main panel, it is possible to move through the
                spectrum of the two sounds. Slow movements allow for spectral exploration, while broader movements
                can create modulations and melodic effects.</p>
            <p>There are three types of movement: <i>manual</i>, <i>linear</i>, and <i>cyclic</i>. The three modes are
                active simultaneously, and their effects are cumulative.</p>
            The details for these modes can be configured in the "Motion" panel, accessible with the M key.
            <p>
                <i>Manual</i>: The <i>x,y</i> point is moved manually with the mouse. The "traction" parameter
                adjusts the responsiveness to mouse movements. Low values result in smoother transitions between
                points.<br>
                <i>Linear</i>: The <i>x,y</i> point moves in a straight line at a constant speed. The x and y
                velocity components can be set independently. At a speed of 1x, the point moves along
                that direction at the original playback speed of the sample.<br>
                <i>Cyclic</i>: The <i>x,y</i> point is modified cyclically. The X Ampl and Y Ampl parameters
                control the amplitude of the modulation. For the other parameters, refer to the graph next to
                them for an intuitive exploration.
