        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Summer 25 is a web application developed in the summer of 2025 to experiment with real-time browser audio, using the phase vocoder synthesis and resynthesis technique, and the interactive spectral combination of two sounds. Additional features were integrated during development.</p>
        <p>The application is not intended for professional use, although it can produce interesting sound combinations. Instead, it is designed as a recreational or educational tool to allow even novice users to experiment with sound synthesis.</p>
        <p>It use two sounds which are mapped to the X and Y axes of the workspace. By moving the mouse, you can select a point within the X sound and the Y sound. At that point, the spectrum is calculated via phase vocoder analysis, the two spectra are combined in various ways, and the result is resynthesized in real-time.</p>

            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>First, load two audio files, one for the X-axis and one for the Y-axis. WAV, MP3, and OGG formats are supported. The application handles both short sounds (samples) and full musical tracks. Some sample files are available in the application (use the "load" button in the "X Wave" and "Y Wave" sections on the left). You can also load your own files from your disk using the "load" buttons or by dragging and dropping them into their respective sections or into the strips above and to the left of the main panel.</p>

            <p>Once the files are loaded, press the Play button at the top left to start the synthesis and move within the main panel while holding down the left mouse button.</p>

            <h2>Motion</h2>
            <p>By varying the <i>x,y</i> coordinates within the main panel, you can move through the spectrum of the two sounds. Slow movements allow for spectral exploration, while broader movements can create modulations and melodic effects.</p>
            <p>There are three movement types: <i>manual</i>, <i>linear</i>, and <i>cyclic</i>. The three modes are active simultaneously, and their effects are summed.</p> 
            The details for these modes can be configured in the "Motion" panel, accessible with the M key.
            <p>
                <i>Manual</i>: The <i>x,y</i> point is moved manually with the mouse. The "traction" parameter adjusts the responsiveness to mouse movements. Low values result in smoother transitions between points.<br>
                <i>Linear</i>: The <i>x,y</i> point moves in a straight line at a constant speed. The x and y speed components can be set independently. At a speed of 1x, the point moves along that direction at the sample's original playback speed.<br>
                <i>Cyclic</i>: The <i>x,y</i> point is changed cyclically. The X Ampl and Y Ampl parameters control the modulation amplitude. For the other parameters, refer to the graph next to them for an intuitive exploration.
